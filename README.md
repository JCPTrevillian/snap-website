# snap-website
\
I wanted to dry run creating a snap slide website before I added css features to each slide. 
I wanted each slide to have an image, text, background with two colors. 
I wanted to be sure the slides did not have any lag or space. These images are of each individual slide. 
The slides without space image is below. Now that I am on track, I will start building more detailed slides
for the final version.

Each slide is "connected" when user scrolls website. I used seven colors that were related so it looks more elegant.
